# cucumber

Example of a Cucumber test project.

I've included three different kinds of test.
- Unit-like test of a calculator:
- Screen test for Wikipedia, with Selenium (work in progress).
- API test for ..., with Rest-Assured (work in progress).

I've also made a TestRunner class (work in progress).
